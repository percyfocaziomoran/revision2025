//Lab:

//Problem 1: RankSort.java
    //Implement Rank Sort using multiple threads. Each thread should sort a part of the array.

//Problem 2: FactorialTask.java
    //Create a thread pool using ExecutorService. Submit tasks that calculate the
    //factorial of numbers from 1 to 5.

//Problem 3: ChangingThreadCount.java
    //Change the size of the thread pool and observe how it affects task completion
    //time.

//Problem 4: PrimeNumberSequential.java UNFINISHED
    //Use the Callable interface to find all prime numbers in the range 1 to 1000.
    //Return the count of primes for each thread.

//Problem 5:
    //Compare execution times for sorting an array sequentially, multi-threaded, and
    //using a thread pool.

//Problem 6:
    //Write programs that compute the sum of a large array sequentially, then using
    //multiple threads. Measure the execution time for each.
